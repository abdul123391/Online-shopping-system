This is a console application consisting of a management layer and a networking layer.
The networking layer is responsible for establishing a connection between a client and the remote sever.

Meanwhile, in the management layer, we have three types of users: customers, employees and the admin.
The customers can not only buy items but also write complaints, which can then be answered by employees and admin.
The employees and admin avail 20% discount on their purchases. An automatic reorder is placed if goods fall below a certain level.

The admin has several privileges. He or she can view records of customers and employees, search for customers and employees,
fire employees, ban customers, view cash details, view inventory level, manually order goods, manually update balance,
and set reorder level, reorder amount, and unit price of each item.
